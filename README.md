## Description
'Snowballs' is a project template created in Spark AR Studio. It features an AR world effect with falling snowflakes and a snowman in the centre of the action.

The user can move the snowman with the tap and hold gesture. On screen tap gesture, the player throws virtual snowballs. The snowballs are pulled towards the ground by gravity. The snowballs splash on collision with the snowman or with the detected plane. The player is prompted and guided with the native instructions through the effect.

## FAQ
### Is the project free?
Yes, the project is free to use. I have created the project for educational purposes, for any AR enthusiasts. Don’t hesitate and modify the project and share the results! Let me know what you have created by tagging me on social media platforms!  
### With which version of Spark AR Studio should I open the project?
Always try to open the project with the up-to-date Spark AR Studio. But if you find it too buggy or you are unable to open it, then try the original version (Spark AR **v127.1**) used to create this project.
### Can I use the project commercially?
Sure, but first check the [GOOD_DEED](https://ShivekXR.com/GoodDeed/) Terms.
### Do I need a license to use the project?
No, you don't need any license to use the project, except for any asset noted in the [Credits](#credits), and I don’t give any warranty for the project. But I reserve a right to forbid you using the project in case you blatantly break the [GOOD_DEED](https://ShivekXR.com/GoodDeed/) terms or scam unaware people.
### Can I share (in any form) the project?
Yes, as long as you don’t break the [GOOD_DEED](https://ShivekXR.com/GoodDeed/) terms or rights of any party. Please check the [Credits section](#credits).
### Do I need to credit your work?
It is not necessary, but advisable.
### I have an idea... but I struggle implementing it to the project. Could you help me?
I wish, but sorry, I can’t promise. If you are looking for help, please join [the official Spark AR Community group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SparkARcommunity). First, try to search the group for answers! If you don’t find any satisfying solutions, then describe your problem as clearly as you can. You can also ask questions on [the official Spark AR Forum](https://sparkar.facebook.com/forum).
### Is the original author a vegan?
Unfortunately, I am not yet, but I cheer the idea of meat-free burgers.
### I like the project, and I have learnt something. Is there a way to return a favour?
I am glad that you like my project and that it helped you create a cool AR effect! I put a lot of effort into creating tutorials and projects for you. If you find them helpful, consider following me on social media platforms. Check the [Author section](#author) for the links. Thank you!
